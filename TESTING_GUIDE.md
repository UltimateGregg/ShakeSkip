# Quick Start: Testing Shake Detection

## üöÄ How to Test the Shake Detection Feature

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed
- Android device or emulator (API 24+)
- Device with accelerometer sensor

---

## Step 1: Build and Install

```bash
cd ShakeSkipPlayer
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Or use Android Studio:
- Open project
- Click "Run" (Shift + F10)
- Select your device

---

## Step 2: Grant Permissions

On first launch, the app will request:
- ‚úÖ Read Media Audio
- ‚úÖ Post Notifications

**Note**: Accelerometer doesn't require runtime permissions!

---

## Step 3: Test Basic Shake Detection

### Method 1: Using Existing Test Code

1. Open `ShakeDetectorTest.kt`
2. Run tests: Right-click ‚Üí Run 'ShakeDetectorTest'
3. Verify all tests pass

### Method 2: Manual Testing on Device

1. **Load some music** into the app
2. **Start playback** of any track
3. **Go to Settings** (if navigation is wired up)
4. **Enable "Shake to Skip"** (should be on by default)
5. **Shake your device firmly** (like shaking a salt shaker)
6. **Observe**:
   - ‚úÖ Device vibrates briefly
   - ‚úÖ Track skips to next song
   - ‚úÖ Shake indicator shows "Shake Active"

### Method 3: Emulator Testing (Limited)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Android Emulator has limited accelerometer simulation
- Use "Virtual Sensors" in Extended Controls
- Or test on physical device for best results

---

## Step 4: Test Sensitivity Adjustment

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Shake Detection**
2. Move **Sensitivity Slider** to different positions:
   - **Gentle** (10-12 m/s¬≤): Very light shake needed
   - **Medium** (16-18 m/s¬≤): Normal shake
   - **Vigorous** (22-25 m/s¬≤): Firm shake required
3. Test shake detection at each level
4. Verify settings persist after closing and reopening app

---

## Step 5: Test Edge Cases

### Test 1: Debounce (No Double-Skip)
- Shake once quickly
- Shake again immediately within 500ms
- ‚úÖ Should only skip once, not twice

### Test 2: Playback State
- Pause music
- Try to shake
- ‚úÖ Should NOT skip (detection disabled when paused)
- Resume playback
- Shake again
- ‚úÖ Should skip (detection re-enabled)

### Test 3: Haptic Feedback
- Enable haptic in settings
- Shake device
- ‚úÖ Should feel vibration
- Disable haptic in settings
- Shake device
- ‚úÖ Should NOT feel vibration (but still skips)

### Test 4: False Positives
- Walk around with phone in pocket
- Walk up/down stairs
- Put phone in car cup holder while driving
- ‚úÖ Should NOT trigger skips during normal movement

---

## Step 6: Check Logs

Enable detailed logging to see shake detection in action:

```bash
adb logcat -s ShakeDetector:D ShakeDetectionService:D PlaybackViewModel:D
```

Expected log output:
```
ShakeDetector: Shake detected! Acceleration: 16.8 m/s¬≤
ShakeDetectionService: Shake detected - triggering callback
PlaybackViewModel: Shake detected - skipping to next track
```

---

## Step 7: Monitor Battery Usage

### Short Test (15 minutes)
1. Fully charge device
2. Enable shake detection
3. Play music for 15 minutes
4. Check battery: Settings ‚Üí Battery
5. ‚úÖ Should use < 1.5% battery

### Long Test (1 hour)
1. Fully charge device
2. Enable shake detection
3. Play music for 1 hour
4. Check battery usage
5. ‚úÖ Should use < 5% battery (target)

---

## Debugging Tips

### Shake Not Detected
- Check if accelerometer available: `adb shell dumpsys sensorservice`
- Verify shake detection enabled in settings
- Try increasing sensitivity (lower threshold)
- Shake harder or more deliberately
- Check logs for "Shake detected" messages

### Too Many False Positives
- Decrease sensitivity (higher threshold)
- Try 18-22 m/s¬≤ range
- Ensure device not in pocket during test
- Avoid testing while walking

### No Haptic Feedback
- Check device has vibrator capability
- Verify haptic feedback enabled in settings
- Some emulators don't support vibration
- Check vibrate permission granted

### Settings Not Persisting
- Check DataStore initialization
- Verify app has storage permissions
- Clear app data and try again
- Check logcat for DataStore errors

## Integration Testing Script

```kotlin
// Add this to your test suite
@Test
fun testShakeToSkipIntegration() {
    // 1. Start playback
    playbackViewModel.playSong(testSong)
    
    // 2. Bind shake detection service
    playbackViewModel.bindServices()
    
    // 3. Enable shake detection
    playbackViewModel.toggleShakeDetection() // if disabled
    
    // 4. Simulate shake (requires instrumented test)
    // triggerShakeEvent()
    
    // 5. Verify next track started
    // verify(playbackService).skipToNext()
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Acceptable |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Detection latency | < 50ms | < 100ms |
| False positive rate | < 1% | < 5% |
| Battery per hour | < 3% | < 5% |
| Memory usage | < 10MB | < 20MB |
| CPU usage (active) | < 5% | < 10% |

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Service not bound"
**Solution**: Ensure `bindServices()` called in ViewModel initialization

### Issue: "No accelerometer found"
**Solution**: 
- Check device specs
- Some emulators don't have sensors
- Test on physical device

### Issue: Shake detection too sensitive/not sensitive enough
**Solution**: Adjust sensitivity in settings (10-25 range)

### Issue: App crashes on shake
**Solution**: 
- Check logcat for stack trace
- Verify all services properly initialized
- Ensure playback service running

---

## Testing on Different Devices

### Recommended Test Devices
- **Google Pixel** (reference device)
- **Samsung Galaxy** (popular manufacturer)
- **OnePlus/Xiaomi** (different sensor calibrations)

### OS Versions to Test
- ‚úÖ Android 7.0 (API 24) - Minimum
- ‚úÖ Android 10.0 (API 29)
- ‚úÖ Android 13.0 (API 33) - New permissions
- ‚úÖ Android 14/15 (latest)

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once testing is complete:
1. ‚úÖ Document any issues found
2. ‚úÖ Adjust default sensitivity if needed
3. ‚úÖ Optimize battery consumption if high
4. ‚úÖ Add user feedback if detection confusing
5. ‚úÖ Prepare for beta testing with real users

---

- ‚úÖ Shake consistently triggers track skip
- ‚úÖ No false positives during normal use
- ‚úÖ Battery impact is acceptable
- ‚úÖ Haptic feedback works correctly
- ‚úÖ Settings persist properly
